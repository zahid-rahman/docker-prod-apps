# Prod fib app

- install docker-compose up first (if you don't have docker desktop)
- run ``docker-compose up`` --build for building custom images only for first time
- run ``docker-compose up`` if you have the custome images already
- if you are using docker desktop then run ``docker compose up``
- if you want to run it on detach mode then run ``docker-compose up -d`` / ``docker compose up -d``
- run ``docker ps`` command to check it's running all related containers or not
